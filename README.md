# Passcrypt

## Description

Passcrypt serves as a reliable password management solution meticulously crafted to safeguard your digital existence. The inspiration behind the development of this application stems from my commitment to preserving the security of valuable information. Recognizing the importance of maintaining a secure repository accessible only by the user, I designed Passcrypt to store passwords in an encrypted format on your local machine. This ensures that you have uninterrupted access to your passwords at any time, even offline. Most significantly, Passcrypt operates independently, eliminating dependence on external factors, thereby providing you with unparalleled control and security.

The project provided a holistic learning experience, encompassing programming proficiency, framework utilization, security considerations, and the importance of user independence and control in software design.

1. C++ Proficiency: The project involved a deep dive into C++ programming, enhancing proficiency in the language. This includes a solid understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, memory management, and low-level system interactions.

2. Qt Framework Mastery: Working with the Qt Framework provided insights into cross-platform application development. Learning to leverage Qt's libraries and tools facilitated the creation of a user-friendly interface and streamlined the development process.

3. Security Implementation: Developing a password manager required a thorough understanding of cryptographic techniques for data encryption. The process of securing sensitive information and ensuring robust protection against potential vulnerabilities was a significant learning aspect.
